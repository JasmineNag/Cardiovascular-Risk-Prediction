The Cardiovascular Risk Prediction dataset is a classification machine learning project based on an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The dataset contains over 4000 records and 15 attributes, including demographic, behavioral, and medical risk factors. The goal of the project is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD). The attributes in the dataset include age, education level, gender, smoking status, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, diabetes status, body mass index, and heart rate, among others.

The dataset provides a unique opportunity for researchers and healthcare professionals to better understand the risk factors for cardiovascular disease and develop more effective prevention and early detection strategies. By analyzing the relationships between the various risk factors and the development of CHD, predictive models can be developed to accurately estimate an individual's risk of developing this disease over a 10-year period.
